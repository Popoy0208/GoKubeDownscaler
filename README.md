## Features ‚ú®

- **Efficient Downscaling**: Automatically reduce the number of replicas in your Kubernetes deployments based on resource usage.
- **Customizable Policies**: Set rules for when and how to downscale your workloads.
- **Lightweight**: Minimal overhead on your cluster performance.
- **Easy Integration**: Works seamlessly with existing Kubernetes setups.
- **Monitoring**: Keep track of downscaling actions through logs and metrics.

## Installation üõ†Ô∏è

To install GoKubeDownscaler, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Popoy0208/GoKubeDownscaler.git
   cd GoKubeDownscaler
   ```

2. Build the application:
   ```bash
   make build
   ```

3. Deploy to your Kubernetes cluster:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
   ```

4. Verify that the deployment is successful:
   ```bash
   kubectl get pods
   ```

## Usage üì¶

After installation, you can start using GoKubeDownscaler by following these steps:

1. Ensure your Kubernetes context is set correctly.
2. Apply your custom configuration:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f config.yaml
   ```

3. Monitor the downscaling process through logs:
   ```bash
   kubectl logs -f <pod-name>
   ```

## Configuration ‚öôÔ∏è

The configuration file allows you to customize how GoKubeDownscaler operates. Here‚Äôs a basic example:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: downscaler-config
data:
  minReplicas: "1"
  maxReplicas: "10"
  scaleDownThreshold: "30" # Percentage of resource usage
```

### Parameters

- **minReplicas**: The minimum number of replicas your workload should maintain.
- **maxReplicas**: The maximum number of replicas allowed.
- **scaleDownThreshold**: The resource usage percentage at which downscaling is triggered.

## How It Works üîç

GoKubeDownscaler continuously monitors the resource usage of your Kubernetes workloads. When the usage drops below the defined threshold, it automatically reduces the number of replicas. This helps you save costs while ensuring that your applications remain responsive.

1. **Monitoring**: GoKubeDownscaler checks resource metrics at regular intervals.
2. **Decision Making**: If the metrics indicate low usage, it decides to downscale.
3. **Execution**: It communicates with the Kubernetes API to adjust the number of replicas.
